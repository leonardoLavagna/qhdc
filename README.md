* `functions` contains utilities to work with the proposed qHDC framework on toy machine learning tasks (cf. `notebooks`).
* `notebooks` contains minimal example notebooks showing possible applications for the proposed architecture.
* `requirements.txt` contains the requirements (install the file before using the code in this repository)
* `LICENSE.txt` MIT License
